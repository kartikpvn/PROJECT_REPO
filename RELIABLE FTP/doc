NETWORK ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISTICS:
100Mbps ethernet link with 20% packet loss and 200ms delay
2 NODES both have the sending and receving programs.
server_final_1.c - sender
client_final_1.c - receiver

AIM : TO DEMONSTRATE SUCCESSFUL TWO AND FRO TRANSFER-RECEIVE OF A FILE WITH FILE SIZE DETERMIEND BY THE USER BETWEEN 2 NODES 
 CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER ON A ETHERNET LINK WITH THE HIGHEST THROUGHPUT.

RELIABLE FTP
Mode of TranSfer - server to client
then a 5sec pause after that client to server


1. make the file with test_file.txt on the client side using the following command:
  if=/dev/zero of=testfile1.txt  bs=1024M  count=1
  
2. run the scripts in the following order 
                 a) NODE-1 : ./TestA.sh -  simulating the NODE-2 which is  waiting for a file that is being sent by the NODE-1,
                                  after receving the file with a 5s pause NODE-2 is sending the same file back to the NODE-1. 
                 
                 b) NODE-2 : ./testB.sh -  simulating the NODE-1 sending a file (size above determined) to NODE-2
                                  and then waiting to get the same file back the NODE-2.
                                      
5. upon completion will get the file testfile_1.txt at the other NODE.  

SCRIPTS
1. THE SCRIPTS ARE HARD CODED WITH CLIENT AND SERVER IP ADDRESS
2. and the end of each script we perform the m5sum to ensure that the files were not corrupted.
